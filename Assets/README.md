Day Planner:

I created a 9-5 workday planner. This item is essential to any in the working world with functions to be able to save upcoming events. In this planner I designed well formatted boxes with the time slots and a save button at the end in order to save one's information. Also, if it is 10 A.M. for example, then the current box would be highlighted in the color blue. Past time slots would be grey and future time slots would be green. There is also a running clock at the top, in military time with the current time and date.
